# Supervised versus Unsupervised Learning

## Supervised Learning

>> Techniques that use example inputs and outputs to learn how to make predictions are known as supervised learning methods.
>> We’ll explore many supervised learning methods in this book, including neural networks, decision trees, support-vector machines, and Bayesian filtering.
>> Applications using these methods “learn” by examining a set of inputs and expected outputs.
>> When we want to extract information using one of these methods, we enter a set of inputs and expect the application to produce an output based on what it has learned so far.

## Unsupervised Learning

>> Clustering is an example of unsupervised learning.
>> Unlike a neural network or a decision tree, unsupervised learning algorithms are not trained with examples of correct answers.
>> Their purpose is to find structure within a set of data where no one piece of data is the answer.
>> In the fashion example given earlier, the clusters don’t tell the retailers what an individual is likely to buy, nor do they make predictions about which fashion island a new person fits into.
>> The goal of clustering algorithms is to take the data and find the distinct groups that exist within it.
>> Other examples of unsupervised learning include non-negative matrix factorization and self-organizing maps.
